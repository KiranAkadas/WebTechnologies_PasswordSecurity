# WebTechnologies_PasswordSecurity
A Project on Password Security


A Simple web Application that uses Angular, Node, Express and Mongo. We have a simple registration page that requires you to set up an account that is stored in MongoDB. We add salt to the password and hash it to encrypt the data before storing it and use the hashed password to authenticate the user.
